This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using YarnSure! Here's a ready-to-save **`README.md`** file content. You can copy this into a file named `README.md` in your project root:

## üìù Project Overview

**EcomNest** is a cross-platform e-commerce sample app built with React Native and TypeScript.
It showcases a product listing, product search, favorites management, and responsive UI for mobile and web.

### Technologies Used

* React Native
* TypeScript
* Redux Toolkit
* Axios (for API calls)
* AsyncStorage (for persistence)
* React Navigation
* i18n (for string localization)
* Jest + @testing-library/react-native (testing)
* FastImage (optimized image rendering)

### Key Features

* Product listing with search and filters (Trending / New / All)
* Add/remove products from favorites
* Favorites persist across app restarts
* Responsive design: mobile (single column) vs web/tablet (two columns)
* Bottom navigation with Home and Favorites
* Performance optimizations: memoization, lazy loading
* Internationalization support using i18n
* Clean component-based architecture

---

## üèó Technical Decisions & Architecture

### State Management

* **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management.
* Favorites functionality and product state are maintained in slices.
* Rationale: predictable, scalable, and TypeScript-friendly state management.

### Component Architecture

* **Functional components** with hooks.
* Shared components (`ProductCard`, `CustomSafeAreaView`, `Text`) are reused across screens.
* Memoization (`React.memo`) applied to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
* Debounced search input to optimize performance.

### Data Persistence

* **AsyncStorage** is used to persist favorites across app restarts.
* Load and save favorites asynchronously on app start and toggle.

### Performance Considerations

* FlatList with `keyExtractor` for efficient rendering.
* ProductCard memoized to reduce re-renders.
* Debounced search input.
* FastImage used for optimized image caching.

### Security Considerations

* API calls are made via Axios.
* No sensitive information stored locally.

### Testing Strategy

* Jest + @testing-library/react-native used for unit tests.
* Component tests for rendering and interactions.
* State/action tests for Redux slices, ensuring favorites add/remove functionality works.

## üì∑ Screenshots / GIFs

1. **Product Listing Screen**
   Shows products, filters, and search functionality.

2. **Favorites Screen**
   Shows favorited products with persistent state.

3. **Responsive Design**
   Web layout shows 2 columns; mobile shows single column.

4. **Details / Product Interaction**
   Toggle favorites, view product details (if implemented).

*(Add GIFs/screenshots here in your project repo.)*

## üõ† Technical Stack

* **Framework:** React Native
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Navigation:** React Navigation
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
* **Storage:** AsyncStorage
* **Networking:** Axios
* **Testing:** Jest + @testing-library/react-native
* **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet
* **Localization:** i18n

---

## üìä Data/API

* **Mock API Endpoint:**

  ```ts
  const API_URL = 'https://mocki.io/v1/c53fb45e-5085-487a-afac-0295f62fb86e';
  ```
* **Sample Data:** `sample.json` contains the sample product structure.

---

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

* Clean and modern interface
* Consistent spacing and typography
* Clear visual hierarchy
* Accessibility-first approach
* Responsive layout: mobile < 768px (1 column), web/tablet ‚â• 768px (2 columns)

### Color Palette

* Primary: #007AFF (iOS Blue)
* Secondary: #5856D6
* Background: #F2F2F7
* Text: #000000 / #FFFFFF
* Success: #34C759
* Error: #FF3B30

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

1. **Component Test:** `ProductCard` renders correctly, displays correct data, and handles user interactions.
2. **Store/Action Test:** Favorites functionality:

   * Add to favorites
   * Remove from favorites
   * Persist state across restarts

If you want, I can **also create a `.zip` with this README and placeholders for screenshots/GIFs** so it‚Äôs ready to submit.  

Do you want me to do that?
```

yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
